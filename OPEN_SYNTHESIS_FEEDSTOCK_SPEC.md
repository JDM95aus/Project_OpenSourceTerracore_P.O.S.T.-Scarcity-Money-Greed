Open Synthesis Feedstock Specification

Version 1.0 | November 2025 | Public Domain

Executive Summary

This document establishes open, non-proprietary standards for nutritional feedstock inputs for countertop food synthesizers. The goal is to prevent corporate enclosure of biological precursors through patent thickets and proprietary formulations, ensuring the post-scarcity food ecosystem remains truly open source.

1. Core Feedstock Classes & Specifications

1.1 Base Nutrient Slurries

Purpose: Primary macronutrient source for structural food matrix formation.

· Open-Source Production Method: Fungal (mycoprotein) bioreactors using agricultural waste

Lipid Base: 10-30% lipids by mass

· Open-Source Production Method: Algal oil extraction (Spirulina, Chlorella)

Carbohydrate Matrix: 20-60% complex carbs

· Open-Source Production Method: Cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose

1.2 Flavor & Aroma Precursors

Purpose: Volatile compounds for taste replication.

Maillard Reactants: Glucose + Amino Acids

· Natural Source: Yeast extract, mushroom powder

Terpenes: Limonene, Pinene

· Natural Source: Citrus waste, pine resin

Sulfur Compounds: Allicin, Methanethiol

· Natural Source: Garlic, cruciferous vegetables

1.3 Texture Modifiers

Purpose: Control mouthfeel and structural integrity.

Gelling Agents: Matrix formation

Emulsifiers: Fat dispersion

· Plant-Based Source: Sunflower lecithin

Fibers: Structural reinforcement

· Plant-Based Source: Oat hull, bamboo fiber

2. Open-Source Production Methods

2.1 Distributed Bioreactor Protocol

For protein/lipid production:

```
Input: Agricultural waste (straw, husks, food waste)
Process: Solid-state fermentation using Trichoderma reesei
Output: Mycoprotein slurry (30-45% protein)
Scale: Bench-top (5L) to community-scale (1000L)
```

2.2 Algal Oil Extraction

For essential fatty acids:

```
Species: Spirulina maxima, Chlorella vulgaris
Growth: Photobioreactor or open ponds
Extraction: Cold press or ethanol solvent
Yield: 15-25% lipid content by dry mass
```

2.3 Community-Scale Hydrolysis

For carbohydrate conversion:

```
Input: Cellulosic biomass (wood chips, crop residues)
Enzyme: Cellulase from Trichoderma fungi
Process: 48-hour enzymatic hydrolysis
Output: Glucose syrup for matrix formation
```

3. Quality & Safety Standards

3.1 Minimum Nutritional Profile

(Per 100g of finished food product)

· Protein: ≥12g
· Essential amino acids: Complete profile
· Lipids: 5-15g (balanced ω-3/ω-6)
· Micronutrients: Fortifiable base

3.2 Contamination Limits

· Microbial: <10,000 CFU/g
· Heavy metals: Below FDA thresholds
· Mycotoxins: Non-detectable

3.3 Stability Requirements

· Shelf life: 6+ months (dry form)
· Reconstitution: 1:3 water ratio
· Storage: Ambient temperature

4. Anti-Enclosure Provisions

4.1 Patent-Busting Formulations

The following combinations are explicitly placed in the public domain to prevent proprietary claims:

Universal Nutrient Matrix:

```
Mycoprotein (30%) + Algal oil (10%) + Oat fiber (5%) + 
Mineral premix (2%) + Vitamin blend (1%) + Water (52%)
```

Flavor Base Template:

```
Yeast extract + Mushroom powder + Tomato powder + 
Nutritional yeast + Sea salt + Herbs (variable ratios)
```

4.2 Open Certification Standard

"OSFS Certified" (Open Synthesis Feedstock Standard)

· Must use only non-proprietary ingredients
· Production methods must be publicly documented
· No patent restrictions on use or modification

4.3 Legal Protection

This specification is released under:

· CC0 1.0 Universal - Public Domain Dedication
· Open Food License - Viral open-source provisions
· Patent Pledge - Users agree not to patent derivatives

5. Implementation Roadmap

Phase 1 (Q1 2026)

· Community bioreactor blueprints
· Basic nutrient slurry recipes
· Quality testing protocols

Phase 2 (Q3 2026)

· Advanced flavor precursor libraries
· Automated quality verification
· Distributed production networks

Phase 3 (2027)

· Full nutrient replication capability
· Global standardization
· Regulatory acceptance frameworks

6. Corporate Strategy Countermeasures

This section explicitly addresses known enclosure attempts:

Against "Molecular Monopoly" Strategy:

· All essential nutrients derivable from public-domain organisms
· No single proprietary molecule required for operation

Against "Cartridge DRM" Strategy:

· Standardized mechanical interfaces (documented herein)
· Multiple sourcing paths for all components
· Open firmware preventing vendor lock-in

Against "Safety Regulation" Strategy:

· Transparent production standards
· Community-based verification
· Open safety data shared globally
