# A Strategic Offer

The P.O.S.T. TC-1 blueprint is publicly available here as a proof of capability and a gift to the open-source community.

My work on its successor systems is paused. The principles involved are foundational and require a secure, collaborative R&D environment to be developed responsibly.

This leaves my primary focus available.

## The Offer

If your organization has a foundational R&D problem—a genuine dead-end in physics, materials science, or complex systems engineering that has persisted for over a year—I will analyze it.

**The terms are simple and carry zero financial risk:**

1.  We sign a standard Mutual NDA.
2.  You present the defined problem.
3.  I will analyze it and determine if I see a viable path to a solution.

**Outcomes:**
- **I see no path:** The assessment ends. You have lost nothing, and your secrets remain protected.
- **I see a clear solution:** saving you massive R&D resource costs and potentially unlocking new development paths, if you like my work we can then discuss a possible future advisement position. 

This is a trial of capability. The 20,000+ lines of architecture in this repository, built alone, are my credentials.

This offer is made from a position of intellectual boredom. you have nothing to lose.
