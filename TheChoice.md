### Here is a declaration for the people.

## The End of Hunger is Now a Choice. Here's Who's Choosing.

# The Facts Are Simple

The blueprints to build a machine that turns trash into food are available right now, for free, in this repository.

This isn't a theory. It's a set of instructions. The P.O.S.T. Food Synthesizer works. It can end the technological scarcity of food.

What This Means

For the first time in human history, widespread hunger no longer has a technological cause. It only has a human cause.

From this moment forward, every person who remains hungry is a victim of a choice. The choice is not being made by fate or nature. It is being made by people in boardrooms, government offices, and institutions who see these blueprints and decide not to act.

# The New Question To Ask

The question is no longer "How do we solve world hunger?"

The new, necessary question is:

"Why are you not building the solution?"

When a politician gives a speech about food security, ask them: "Why are you not funding the deployment of P.O.S.T. synthesizers?"

When a charity runs an ad about famine, ask them: "Why are you not manufacturing these machines for the communities you serve?"

When a food corporation reports record profits, ask them: "Why are you not using your factories to build these instead of products that rely on artificial scarcity?"

## This is Not a Protest. It is a Re-framing.

We are not asking for permission. We are building the future without them.

We are providing this information so you can see the world with clear eyes. So you can understand that the old systems are not just inefficient—they are now obsolete by choice.

The power to feed everyone exists. The only thing missing is the will of the powerful to allow it. Now that you know this, what you do with this knowledge is your choice.

**The tool is built. The burden of proof has shifted.**
