# PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE: Integrated Waste-to-Energy System for Distributed Food/Water Platforms
## Disclosure Date: November 10, 2025
## Inventor: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk
## Prior Art For: All integrated thermal conversion systems powering food and water synthesis units

### Core Innovation Claim
This disclosure establishes prior art for systems that:
1.  Convert mixed waste streams (biomass, plastic, MSW) to electrical power via gasification
2.  Directly integrate said power output with open-source food synthesis systems (Terracore Mk2)
3.  Utilize waste products (biochar) from the energy process for water filtration (Terracore Mk3)
4.  Operate as a decentralized, sub-10kW unit for household/community use

### Technical Principles
- Use of downdraft gasification reactor achieving >1200°C reduction zone temperatures
- Syngas composition: CO, H₂, CH₄ with particulate removal via packed-bed filtration
- Direct coupling of syngas output to modified internal combustion generators
- Thermal integration: waste heat recovery from reactor for complementary processes

### System Integration Claim
This prior art specifically covers the synergistic combination of:
[Food Synthesis] ← [Electrical Power] ← [Waste Gasification] → [Biochar] → [Water Filtration]

### Legal Notice
This public disclosure establishes prior art invalidating any patent claims filed after this date covering integrated food-water-energy systems based on thermal waste conversion.

**Note:** Full technical specifications, manufacturing blueprints, and build instructions for the Terracore Mk4 "PyroCore" system will be released December 1, 2025.
