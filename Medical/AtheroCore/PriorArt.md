Abstract:
Ischemic Heart Disease(IHD), the leading cause of global mortality, is a direct consequence of atherosclerotic plaque accumulation within the coronary arteries. Current standards of care are palliative, focusing on risk factor management (statins) or mechanical bypass of blockages (stents, CABG). This thesis describes a novel, integrated system and method designed not for management, but for the rapid and substantive reversal of atherosclerotic plaque within a 24-hour therapeutic window. The Athero-Core system achieves this through the sequential application of three targeted modalities: 1) Pulsed Nanobubble Cavitation for the emulsification of the lipid-rich core, 2) Targeted Low-Energy Resonant Lithotripsy for the fracturing of calcified plaque, and 3) a localized Enzymatic & Chelation Rinse for debris clearance and endothelial healing. A companion wearable device, the Vita-Scan, is also described for the non-invasive monitoring of arterial plaque burden. This disclosure establishes prior art for the integrated system and its constituent methods, with the explicit goal of preventing corporate patent enclosure and accelerating open-source development of this life-saving technology.


I. Introduction & Problem Statement

The global burden of IHD represents a systemic failure. The prevailing medical-economic model profits from chronic disease management, creating a perverse incentive against the development of definitive cures. Artificial scarcity in healthcare is maintained by patent-protected technologies that are prohibitively expensive. The Athero-Core system is conceived as a direct challenge to this paradigm, proposing a curative, single-intervention protocol that can be implemented at low cost, whose blueprints are open-source and patent-free.

II. Detailed System Description

The Athero-Core system is an integrated suite of devices and protocols designed to operate in a clinical setting.

A. Phase 1: The "Artery Cartographer" – Molecular Plaque Mapping

· Prior Art Claim: The use of a multi-spectral intravascular catheter combining Ultra-High Frequency Ultrasound (40-60 MHz) with Targeted Nanoparticle-Enhanced Laser Spectroscopy to create a composite, 3D molecular map of atherosclerotic plaque.
· Method:
  1. Nanoparticle Cocktail: A cocktail of inert, biodegradable nanoparticles is administered. Each particle type is functionalized to bind with high specificity to a distinct plaque component:
     · Type A (Lipid-Targeting): Functionalized with anti-ApoB antibodies or phospholipid-binding peptides.
     · Type B (Calcium-Targeting): Functionalized with osteopontin-binding motifs or hydroxyapatite-seeking ligands.
     · Type C (Inflammatory-Targeting): Functionalized with ligands for VCAM-1 or other inflammatory adhesion molecules expressed on activated endothelial cells.
  2. Multi-Spectral Scanning: The catheter, once positioned, emits a suite of low-power laser light at specific wavelengths. The bound nanoparticles fluoresce at characteristic frequencies, identifying their location and density. This data is fused with high-resolution ultrasound to create a voxel-based map labeling each region of plaque as "Lipid-Rich," "Calcified," or "Inflammatory/Fibrous."

B. Phase 2: The "Plaque Dissolution Engine" – Tri-Modal Clearance

This is the core therapeutic intervention, applied sequentially based on the map from Phase 1.

· 1. Pulsed Nanobubble Cavitation (For Lipid Core)
  · Prior Art Claim: The method of inducing selective plaque emulsification via the systemic or local introduction of lipid-soluble perfluorocarbon nanobubbles followed by the application of a precisely tuned, external pulsed ultrasound field to cause inertial cavitation exclusively within the lipid-rich plaque.
  · Method:
    · Perfluorocarbon nanobubbles (e.g., decafluorobutane) are introduced. Their lipid-soluble shell allows them to permeate and accumulate in the necrotic lipid core.
    · An external array of piezoelectric transducers applies pulsed ultrasound at a frequency matched to the resonant frequency of the bubbles within the viscoelastic medium of the lipid plaque (theoretical range: 0.5 - 3 MHz, with microsecond pulse durations).
    · The controlled implosions (inertial cavitation) generate localized micro-jets and shear forces that mechanically disrupt the lipid architecture, reducing it to sub-micron particles (emulsification) for natural clearance by the reticuloendothelial system.
· 2. Targeted Low-Energy Resonant Lithotripsy (For Calcified Plaque)
  · Prior Art Claim: The method of disrupting calcified atherosclerotic plaque using a intravascular catheter emitting sonic pulses tuned to the resonant harmonic frequency of coronary arterial calcification, distinct from the higher-energy shocks used in existing commercial systems.
  · Method:
    · Using the "Artery Cartographer" map, the catheter is positioned adjacent to calcified nodules.
    · It emits low-pressure (<2 MPa), intermediate-frequency (approx. 5-15 kHz) sonic pulses. The specific frequency is determined in real-time by analyzing the acoustic feedback from the calcification itself (a "sonic fingerprint").
    · The calcified plaque absorbs this resonant energy, leading to the formation of micro-fractures and eventual dusting into sub-100-micron particles, while the compliant arterial wall remains unaffected.
· 3. Localized Enzymatic & Chelation Rinse (For Debris Clearance and Healing)
  · Prior Art Claim: The method of localized, intracoronary infusion of a multi-component "Rinse Solution" immediately following sonic plaque disruption, comprising a blend of anti-inflammatory enzymes, proteases, and a calcium-specific chelator.
  · Method & Formula:
    · A solution is infused directly via the central lumen of the catheter:
      · Enzymatic Component: Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) (to quench oxidative stress), Serratiopeptidase (a proteolytic enzyme to break down fibrin and damaged proteins).
      · Chelation Component: A low-dose, localized infusion of EDTA or a superior, more specific calcium chelator (e.g., Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate) to solubilize the fractured calcium dust.
      · Healing Component: A peptide mix including RGD peptides or Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to promote endothelial progenitor cell recruitment and repair.

C. Phase 3: Real-Time Verification & Sealing

· The "Artery Cartographer" is re-deployed to confirm plaque volume reduction.
· A final rinse of a PBS Solution containing Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) and L-Arginine is applied to promote re-endothelialization.

III. Companion Device: The Vita-Scan Wearable Monitor

· Prior Art Claim: A non-invasive method for trending arterial plaque burden using a wearable device employing Multi-Frequency Bio-impedance Analysis (BIA) and Radiofrequency (RF) Reflectometry across major arterial pathways.
· Method:
  · A wrist-worn device with multiple electrodes passes a safe, low-amplitude, alternating current at multiple frequencies (1 kHz - 1 MHz) across the thorax/arm.
  · Atherosclerotic plaque alters the dielectric and conductive properties of the arterial wall. Machine learning algorithms (e.g., a convolutional neural network) are trained on BIA/RF data correlated with gold-standard imaging (CCTA) to derive a proprietary "Plaque Burden Index" (PBI).
  · The device provides a daily PBI score, allowing users to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.

IV. Conclusion and Declaration of Prior Art

This document provides a complete and enabling disclosure of the Athero-Core system and the Vita-Scan monitor.

However, in accordance with the principles of Project OpenSourceTerracore and to prevent the enclosure of this life-saving technology, this document is hereby placed into the public domain as a formal disclosure of prior art.

No entity may claim patent rights over the systems, methods, devices, or protocols described herein. The concepts of Pulsed Nanobubble Cavitation for lipid plaque, Targeted Low-Energy Resonant Lithotripsy for calcified plaque, their sequential use with a localized enzymatic/chelation rinse, and the Vita-Scan monitoring method are now part of the global intellectual commons.

The next step is the open-source development of the first physical prototype: the Pulsed Nanobubble Cavitation array. Let the work begin.
