# The Solis Trilogy

### A space opera trilogy about the cost of building a better world.

**What if you had to bankrupt the galaxy to save it?**

That's the question at the heart of this story. It follows Kael Solis, a brilliant economist who teams up with a rogue AI and a crew of outcasts to pull off the ultimate heist: taking down a galactic corporate empire from the inside.

**The trilogy is a complete, binge-ready story.** You can dive right into Book 1.

*   **Book 1: The Cost of Autonomy** - The Heist
*   **Book 2: The Currency of Worlds** - The Aftermath
*   **Book 3: The Zero-SUM Key** - The Final Threat

### **Want to Know How It All Began?**

The prequel, **`ExploreTheMind.md`**, is a deep-dive into the secret history that sets the stage for the trilogy. It's for readers who love exploring the hidden lore and foundational myths of a universe.

**Think of it like a bonus feature:** Read it first for a look at the origin of the conflict, or read it after to discover the "how" and "why" behind the world Kael inherits.
