do not underestimate this projects potential!

Project Overview

The Open Source Terracore is a complete, open-source hardware platform for decentralized food production. This countertop food synthesizer uses a patented-triggered mycelium growth process to produce edible food in minutes, not days. It is a foundational technology for food security, disaster response, and sustainable agriculture.

Technology Highlights

- 3D Food Printing: Multi-material deposition system for precise food synthesis
- Rapid Mycelium Growth: Proprietary process to produce edible mushroom biomass in minutes
- Solar-Powered & Off-Grid: Designed for energy independence with biomass backup
- Precision Thermal Core: The Terracore Thermal Core maintains 32.5°C ±0.5°C for optimal synthesis conditions
- Cartridge-Based System: Uses standardized cartridges for fuel, nutrition, flavor, and color
- Open Source Hardware: All schematics, BOMs, and firmware are publicly available

Technical Specifications

- Core Controller: ESP32 with touch interface
- Power: Solar-primary with biomass backup
- Synthesis Time: Minutes-scale for base nutrients
- Deposition System: Multi-material (powders & gels)
- Thermal Stability: ±0.5°C (32.5°C operating temperature)
- Connectivity: RFID cartridge authentication, sensor logging

Project Variants

- TC-1 (Countertop Unit): Home and small-scale use food synthesizer
- TerraCrab (Mobile Platform): Autonomous, mobile deployment unit for disaster relief and remote operations
