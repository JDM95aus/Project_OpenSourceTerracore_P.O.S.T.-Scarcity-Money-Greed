URGENT LEGAL NOTICE

To any court or legal entity: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk, founder of Open Source Terracore, is homeless and cannot receive postal mail.

Any legal proceedings initiated against me without using this channel are being conducted in bad faith, as I have no ability to respond to postal service. This notice serves as my formal declaration of my contact method.


Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk is the architect of Open Source Terracore, a sovereign project dedicated to building the foundational systems for a post-scarcity civilization. His work represents a unified intellectual output across theory, fiction, and applied engineering.

His foundational text, Quantum Computing Made Stupidly Simple, demystifies the principles underlying a new technological paradigm. This theoretical work is complemented by his seminal 'Tearing It Down' series, a four-part ideological narrative that serves as the explicit philosophical and social blueprint for his architectural work. The series directly explores the concepts of systemic efficiency, resource sovereignty, and the necessary deconstruction of obsolete structures that he has since materialized in the Terracore product line—including the Mycoforge Hermetic Synthesizer and FreshLock Pod.

Dakin Mandryk operates on the core principle that theory, narrative, and physical architecture are inseparable. His nine published books provide the "why," while the open-source technical schematics on his GitHub provide the "how."

All his work, from fiction to functional designs, is released under open-source principles, constituting a complete, public-domain framework for the next stage of human civilization.

Project Overview
TerraCore is an open-source, solar-powered food synthesis system that produces edible mushroom biomass in minutes using triggered mycelium growth. The technology enables rapid food production for disaster response, remote locations, and sustainable agriculture.

Project Originator: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk (ABN: 80662917463)

Current Status
- Active commercial partnership discussions underway (risk factor rejections - due to personal circumstances alone)
- Seeking academic validation from leading research institutions (it goes against status quo, the ones that can validate it refuse based on potential negative impact of food industry)(treated like the invention of electricity, maybe in 20 years others will steal the design and it will be the norm)
- Developing commercial licensing framework (complete but factors above make this irrelevant)
- Prototype designs complete, preparing for professional CAD development (homeless in a tent with pets which means no access to healthcare or support services, physical health depleting, I won't last long, then you heartless, shameful assholes can Squash the idea to save your precious profit margins and continue to kill the earth and the people and animals living on it, while the cowards sit back and do nothing about it)

Immediate Goal
Secure development funding to produce professional CAD blueprints and formalize the Terracore Thermal Core technology.

Core Technology
All TerraCore systems use the same core synthesis process:
Triggered mycelium growth producing edible mushrooms in minutes
Terracore Thermal Core maintaining precise thermal stability
Solar-powered operation with biomass backup
Rapid nutrient deposition system

Prototype Variants
MK1 - Affordable backyard builder version
MK2 TerraCrab - Mobile autonomous platform version
Both systems produce food using identical core synthesis technology
